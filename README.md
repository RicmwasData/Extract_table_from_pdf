Extracting Tables From PDF
=============
This project provides a Python-based solution for extracting tables from password-protected PDF files, processing the extracted data, and merging them into a single structured DataFrame. The resulting DataFrame can then be exported for further analysis or visualization.

Features

Handle multiple tables and merge them into one DataFrame.

Dynamically locate table headers for correct data alignment.

Skip tables without valid headers (e.g., tables missing the required "Trans" header).

Error handling for edge cases and missing data.
